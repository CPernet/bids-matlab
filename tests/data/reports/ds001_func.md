FUNC REPORT


The data acquisition was performed in the XInstitutionNameX, XInstitutionalDepartmentNameX,
XInstitutionAddressX.

Recordings were acquired using the XManufacturersModelNameX system from XManufacturerX,
with serial number XDeviceSerialNumberX. The software version was XSoftwareVersionsX.

For the balloon analog risk task, Xn_runsX run(s) of XPulseSequenceTypeX XScanningSequenceX
XSequenceVariantX fMRI data were collected. The acquisiton parameters
were: Xn_slicesX slices acquired in a Xso_strX fashion; repetition time, TR= 2
ms; echo time, TE= XteX ms; flip angle, FA= XFlipAngleX deg; field of view, FOV=
XfovX mm; matrix size= XmsX; voxel size= XvsX mm; multiband factor= Xmb_strX;
in-plane acceleration factor= Xpr_strX. Each run was XlengthX minutes in length,
during which Xn_volsX functional volumes were acquired.
