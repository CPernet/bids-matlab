The data acquisition was performed in the InstitutionName, InstitutionalDepartmentName, 
InstitutionAddress.
Recordings were acquired using the ManufacturersModelName system from Manufacturer, 
with serial number DeviceSerialNumber. The software version was SoftwareVersions.
For the balloon analog risk task, [XXn_runsXX] run(s) of PulseSequenceType ScanningSequence 
SequenceVariant fMRI data were collected ([XXn_slicesXX] slices acquired 
in a [XXso_strXX] fashion; repetition time, TR= 2 ms; echo time, TE= [XXteXX] 
ms; flip angle, FA= FlipAngle deg; field of view, FOV= [XXfovXX] mm; matrix size= 
[XXmsXX]; voxel size= [XXvsXX] mm; multiband factor= [XXmb_strXX]; in-plane 
acceleration factor= [XXpr_strXX]). Each run was [XXlengthXX] minutes in length, 
during which [XXn_volsXX] functional volumes were acquired.
