ANATOMICAL REPORT

The data acquisition was performed in the XXXInstitutionNameXXX, XXXInstitutionalDepartmentNameXXX, 
XXXInstitutionAddressXXX.
Recordings were acquired using the XXXXXXManufacturerXXXsModelNameXXX system from 
XXXManufacturerXXX, with serial number XXXDeviceSerialNumberXXX. The software 
version was XXXSoftwareVersionsXXX.
XXXPulseSequenceTypeXXX XXXScanningSequenceXXX XXXSequenceVariantXXX structural 
MRI data were collected ([XXn_slicesXX] slices; repetition time, TR= XXXRepetitionTimeXXX 
ms; echo time, TE= [XXteXX] ms; flip angle, FA= XXXFlipAngleXXX deg; field 
of view, FOV= [XXfovXX] mm; matrix size= [XXmsXX]; voxel size= [XXvsXX] mm)



FUNCTIONAL REPORT

The data acquisition was performed in the XXXInstitutionNameXXX, XXXInstitutionalDepartmentNameXXX, 
XXXInstitutionAddressXXX.
Recordings were acquired using the XXXXXXManufacturerXXXsModelNameXXX system from 
XXXManufacturerXXX, with serial number XXXDeviceSerialNumberXXX. The software 
version was XXXSoftwareVersionsXXX.
For the N-Back, 2 run(s) of XXXPulseSequenceTypeXXX XXXScanningSequenceXXX XXXSequenceVariantXXX 
fMRI data were collected ([XXn_slicesXX] slices acquired in a [XXso_strXX] 
fashion; repetition time, TR= 2.5 ms; echo time, TE= [XXteXX] ms; flip 
angle, FA= XXXFlipAngleXXX deg; field of view, FOV= [XXfovXX] mm; matrix size= 
[XXmsXX]; voxel size= [XXvsXX] mm; multiband factor= [XXmb_strXX]; in-plane acceleration 
factor= [XXpr_strXX]). Each run was [XXlengthXX] minutes in length, during 
which [XXn_volsXX] functional volumes were acquired.
